New version of framework comes with great deal of changes and still is in beta, but definetly worth looking at.
<!-- more -->
Some of the biggest chenges are:

    - framework start using namespases
    - redused number of singletons in project
    - framework heavily rely on Dependency Injection(DI) and Dependency Injection Container(DIC)

To explain this concept there is [tutorial](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Zend+DI+QuickStart)

[packages.zendframework.com](http://packages.zendframework.com/) is great place to start. There you can in
various ways download and install framework. Also it has usefull links to api, blog and wiki.

[Rob Allen's (Akrabat) tutorial](http://akrabat.com/zend-framework/updated-tutorial-for-zend-framework-2-beta-1/) has been updated
to support first beta of framework. In this tutorial you can create simple catalog app using Zend Framework 2.

Also there you can find link to [ZendSkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication) and
way to get application and frameworn in one simple git clone.
