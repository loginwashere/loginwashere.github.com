Comes to end year of owning my first hosting. I win it in New Year contest from Logol on habrahabr.ru.
Nice hosting, but paying even small amount of money for the thing you use one or two times a month
(games twitter and work take almost all my time) is inpractical.

About half a year ago i've discovered posibility of hosting site on github. Some time latter i tryed heroku - so paying
money for something you can get free - no way.

And at last i've found time to transfer my almost empty wordpress blog to octopress and host it on github. Choosing heroku you
can get private repository for your blog or whatever you what to host there. But it wasn't critical for me so here i am on github.

Site is completely static now - just a bunch of html pages generated by Jakyll. And still it has:

    * comments thanks to Disqus,
    * latest projects from github and tweets,
    * code highlight

What else do i realy need?
