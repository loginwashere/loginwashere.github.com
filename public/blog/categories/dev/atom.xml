<p>If you saw this film - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/">The Graduate</a>, you may remember something weird in that scene.</p>

<p>At last. Wow it was cool. Yay yeah. Wait, now what?</p>

<p>Happy pair enter the bus, they are laughing and shining with joy and then you notice something, as if they start to grasp
what happened. I can't say that I felt exactly the same, but it was close. Maybe both cases can be connected with the
accomplishment of the goal, maybe something else, I'll try to look closer and investigate this question, but not in this post.</p>

<p>So, "Zend PHP Certification" - basic facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>70 questions: various difficulty</li>
<li>90 minutes: you manage time, can skip questions, mark questions for future review</li>
<li>three question types: one answer, multiple answers (number of right answers is specified) and one where you need to type answer (nothing long)</li>
</ul>


<p>Sources that helped me to prepare for certification:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/">php.net/manual/en/</a> - this is obvious</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification-study-guide">The Zend PHP Certification Study Guide</a> - this
guide covers fast forward all topics of the certification and has samples of questions.</li>
<li><a href="http://3v4l.org/">3v4l.org</a> - cool site which allow you to run php code against almost all versions of php</li>
<li><a href="http://zend-php.appspot.com/questions_list">zend-php.appspot.com/questions_list</a> - list of questions that you may or may
not see in test. Be cautious - check answers and read comments - not all questions solves in a right way. This may be confusing but also can be helpful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/carlosbuenosvinos/zend-php-53-demo-certification-test">http://www.slideshare.net/carlosbuenosvinos/zend-php-53-demo-certification-test</a> - this
presentation contains questions from if i'm not mistaken php 5.3 study guide and is quite old but also can be helpful.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This one can save some time for you. How much? It depends on how often you use vim and what you do with it.</p>

<p>Imagine you opened a document im vim and started making changes. Time goes by and you decide to save the document.
And guess what - you do not have permissions to do this. You opened some config in /etc/something but you did this as regular user.</p>

<p>At this point you have several ways to overcome this problem, but I only use this one lately.</p>

<p>All you need is instead of typing</p>

<p><code>
:w
</code></p>

<p>to save document, type</p>

<p><code>
:w sudo tee  %
</code></p>

<p>Well, I won't pretend, at the moment I do not know what this command do exactly, but it helps.
This way you can save document (if you know user password or user do not need one and if user can run sudo command)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This one snippet also start to appear in my search results more often.</p>

<p>```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no user@192.168.33.10 "mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The key part of this one liner is:</p>

<p><code>
-o PubkeyAuthentication=no
</code></p>

<p> You can't specify it for ssh-copy-id and without it you get this error</p>

<p><code>
$ Received disconnect from host: 2: Too many authentication failures for user
</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a quite long period of time I've been using this method to delete remote tag in git repository:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find myself in a situation when you totally need to remove that pushed tag</li>
<li>Feel frustrated, because even after doing this more than 10 times I still fail to remember the command</li>
<li>Google the command</li>
<li>Click on that purple link - first in search results for "git delete remote tag"</li>
<li>Look at the command and feel embarrassed again</li>
<li>Copy paste the command to the terminal window.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today  must admit that I have the problem and the first step to overcome it - add link to solution to this blog:</p>

<p><code>
git tag -d 12345
git push origin :refs/tags/12345
</code></p>
